Harry welcomes fellow podcaster Ann Kingman to the show to discuss Marie Kondo's _The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up_, including how they've tackled cleaning their own homes after reading the book, why the book has taken off like a rocket, and whether it truly is as life-changing as the title would lead one to believe.

In addition, not only would we love more reviews on iTunes, but we'd be grateful if you, dear listener(s), would look deep into your hearts and purses and consider contributing to our Patreon campaign. We love doing this show, but it takes a lot to put it together and the extra income would be a huge help to us.
