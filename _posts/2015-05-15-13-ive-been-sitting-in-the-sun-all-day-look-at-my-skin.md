__Synopsis:__ Aleen from [Less Than Or Equal](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/less-than-or-equal/id890268267?mt=2) podcast joins us once again. We discussed a variety of interesting topics, from the Konami/Kojima disaster, Black Widow being erased from her own scene in the official toy line, Assassin's Creed gets a female protagonist, the awful 1979 and 1990 Captain American movies, and finally a quick look to the past with the Philips CD-i console and Sega Genesis/CD/32x disaster.
