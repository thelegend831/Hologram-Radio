Harry sits down with Penguin Random House audiobook producer Julie Wilson to discuss the ins-and-outs of making an audiobook come to life. From selecting the book, to choosing the right narrator(s) for the job, to mixing it all down into the final product, Julie invites listeners behind the scenes of a part of the publishing industry always heard, but rarely seen.
