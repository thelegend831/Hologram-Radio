  Aaaaaaand we're back! It's been an incredible hibernation. Michael and Alex rebooted the show with a new format. The Impromptu is no longer a weekly "what's new in tech" show. We decided there's a glut of podcasts that already cover that really well, so we now just talk about our passions as they relate to video games, comics, film, art, and other forms of media...

__Synopsis:__ Aaaaaaand we're back! It's been an incredible hibernation. Michael and Alex rebooted the show with a new format. The Impromptu is no longer a weekly "what's new in tech" show. We decided there's a glut of podcasts that already cover that really well, so we now just talk about our passions as they relate to video games, comics, film, art, and other forms of media.

Gender equality and representation is something we broach in this first half of our return to greatness (expect more discussions on this as we tread into new territory for the show). Over the next few weeks we shall be inviting some guests on of the opposite gender as we attempt to diverse our conversations to include different perspectives.

So sit back, put your headphones on, and grab a cup of fussy brewed coffee! Part 2 of "Welcome Back" will drop in a few days once you've had some time to digest. Oh, and in case you haven't already noticed, since this is a series reboot, we're going all DC new52 and are starting at number one again.

__Duration:__ 56:05

__Present:__ Michael, Alex
