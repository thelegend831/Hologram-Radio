I’ve assembled a list of resources to help COVERED listeners prepare for my discussion with fellow podcaster [Ann Kingman](http://twitter.com/annkingman) about Marie Kondo’s _The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up_. Below, you’ll find videos and articles, including interviews with the author, as well as how others have applied her techniques to their lives.

And since this is a book club discussion, I’ve dropped in some links to the book itself in case you wanted to read up before the episode drops.

I hope these links and the forthcoming episode bring you joy!
